ModelFed
==========

ModelFed is a federated protocol that standardizes collaborative model design and management 
across diverse modeling platforms. ModelFed extends the 
`Activity Streams 2.0 <https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/>`_
protocol to incorporate modeling concepts and introduces an API for managing server-to-server
interactions between modeling platforms.

ModelFed adopts a federated architecture, where modeling platforms maintain their own data 
and policies but synchronize changes via a shared protocol, eliminating the need for a central 
server while ensuring interoperability.
