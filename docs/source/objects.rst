Objects
=======

The following diagram shows the concepts of the ModelFed vocabulary and their relationships.
*Objet* is the core concept of the :doc:`ModelFed vocabulary <vocabulary>`, defined in the
`Activity vocabulary <https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/>`_ as an entity of
any kind. Every *Object, identified by a globally unique URI, falls into one of four main
categories (*ModelElements*, *Activities*, *Actors*, and *Grants*).

ModelElements
-------------
*ModelElement*, which inherits from Object, is an abstract concept that serves as a general
representation of any element within a model. The ModelFed vocabulary provides a pragmatic
representation of the UML specification for structural models. Concepts such as *Classes*,
*Enumerations*, *Associations*, and *Generalizations* can be defined to build a domain model.
As an example, the following JSON-LD defines a class named *ProductPassport* with a string
attribute (*name*). Note that every object includes an *id* for global identification and
a *type* for object classification.

.. code-block:: json

    {
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
        "https://www.modelfed.com/ns/modelfed"
    ],
    "type": "Class",
    "id": "https://platformA.com/classes/product_passport",
    "name": "ProductPassport",
    "attributes": [
        {
        "type": "Property",
        "id": "https://platformA.com/properties/name",
        "name": "name",
        "elementType": "str"
        }
    ]
    }

Activities
----------

*Activities* enable the specification of actions performed on any *Object*.
ModelFed defines five activities: *Create*, *Update*, *Delete*, *Reclassify*, and *Clone*.

The following is the definition of an Activity to create the *LifecicleStage* class. It includes:

- ``@context`` to define the vocabulary used in the JSON-LD document.
- ``type`` to define the type of activity (in this case, *Create*).
- ``id`` to define the globally unique identifier of the activity.
- ``actor`` to define the actor who performed the activity.
- ``to`` to define the actors with whom the activity is federated.
- ``object`` to define the object on which the activity is performed (the *LifecicleStage* class with the *start* attribute).
- ``timestamp`` to define the date and time of the activity.

.. code-block:: json

    {
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
        "https://www.modelverse.com/ns/modelverse"
    ],
    "type": "Create",
    "id": "http://platformA.com/activities/a1c2t3",
    "actor": "https://platformC.com/industrialeng/",
    "to": [
        "http://platformA.com/admin/"
    ],
    "object": {
        "type": "LifecicleStage",
        "id": "https://platformC.com/classes/life_cicle_stage",
        "name": "LifecicleStage",
        "attributes": [
            {
            "type": "Property",
            "id": "https://platformC.com/properties/lf_start",
            "name": "start",
            "elementType": "date"
            }
        ]
        "owner": "https://platformA.com/domain_model/dpp_model"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-02-11T15:42:45Z"
    }

Actors
------

In ModelFed, *Actors* are the people, organizations, services, or applications that can perform activities within a model.

Each modeling platform participating in Modelverse must manage a basic set of information for every actor, as required by 
the ModelFed protocol:

- ``id``: A unique identifier
- ``type``: What kind of actor it is (e.g., person, service)
- ``name``: A human-readable name
- ``inbox``: Where the actor receives shared activities
- ``outbox``: Where the actor sends activities to others

The following is an example of a JSON-LD document defining a *Person* actor called *Materials Scientist*.

.. code-block:: json

    {
    "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "https://www.modelverse.com/ns/modelverse"
    ],
    "type": "Person",
    "id": "https://platformB.com/materialsscientist",
    "name": "Materials Scientist",
    "inbox": "https://platformA.com/materialsscientist/inbox",
    "outbox": "https://platformA.com/materialsscientist/outbox"
    }

*Actors* collaborate by sending and receiving activities using their inbox and outbox:

- The outbox is where an actor publishes activities they perform.
- The inbox is where they receive activities shared by others.

This direct actor-to-actor communication is what powers federation in Modelverse, where thereâ€™s no central hub, 
just peers talking to each other.

Grants
------

In ModelFed, `Grants` control who can do what. They define permissions for each actor, specifying which model elements 
an actor can interact with, and what kind of activities they are allowed to perform.

A `Grant` links:

- An *Actor* (e.g., a person)
- A Model Element (what they can access)
- A Role (what level of access they have)

There are three different roles defined in ModelFed.

   :header-rows: 1

   * - *Role*
     - *Access Level*
   * - Administrator
     - Full control (can edit, delete, and assign new Grants)
   * - Editor
     - Read and write access (but cannot delete)
   * - Reader
     - Read-only access
