# ModelFed

ModelFed is a federated protocol that standardizes collaborative model design and management across 
diverse modeling platforms. It extends the [Activity Streams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/) protocol to support modeling-specific concepts.

This repository contains:

- Full ModelFed documentation: the documentation, including the vocabulary extension of the ModelFed protocol is accesible in [this link](https://creative-tanuki-e14560.netlify.app/).
- [Prototype implementation](prototype/main.py): A prototype with two modeling platforms implementing the ModelFed protocol to create models in a collaborative way, was developed for validation purposes.
- [Validation results](validation/README.md): Experimental results testing the protocol's effectiveness.
